"""Problem Description

Take T (number of test cases) as input.

For each test case, take integer N as input, you have to tell whether it is a perfect number or not.

A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper positive divisors (excluding the number itself). A positive proper divisor divides a number without leaving any remainder.



Problem Constraints

1 <= T <= 10

1 <= N <= 106



Input Format

The first line of the input contains a single integer T.

Each of the next T lines contains a single integer N.



Output Format

In a separate line, print YES if a given integer is perfect, else print NO.



Example Input

Input 1:

 2
 4
 6 
Input 2:

 1
 3 


Example Output

Output 1:

 NO
 YES 
Output 2:

 NO 


Example Explanation

Explanation 1:

 For A = 4, the answer is "NO" as sum of its proper divisors = 1 + 2 = 3, is not equal to 4. 
 For A = 6, the answer is "YES" as sum of its proper divisors = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6, is equal to 6. 
Explanation 2:

 For A = 3, the answer is "NO" as sum of its proper divisors = 1, is not equal to 3. """
 
 Solution:
 
 def main():
    N = int(input())
    for i in range(N):
        A = int(input())
        sumo = 0
        for i in range(1,A):
            if A % i == 0:
                sumo += i  
        if sumo == A:
            print("YES")
        else:
            print("NO")
